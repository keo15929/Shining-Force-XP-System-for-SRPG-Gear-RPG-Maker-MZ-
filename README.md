This plugin makes it so that characters require a static 100 xp to level. 
Each kill of an enemy of the same level rewards 48xp. Each hit of a same level enemy uses scaling xp rewards.
Healing allies uses scaling xp depending on level of ally healed and percentage of its total health replinished.
By putting a <promoted> tag in a class made to be promoted will treat that class as if it were level 21 even though it starts at level 1. This is to prevent high xp gains from hits of higher level enemies and kills of lower level enemies.
